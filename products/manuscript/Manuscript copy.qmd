# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

## Description of data and data source
The primary data source for this project is the Safe Drinking Water Infromation System (SDWIS) maintianed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). SDWIS is a national databased maintained by the EPA to monitor compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. The data are collected through reports submitted by public water systems and state primacy agencies, including detailed information on water system characteristics and drinking water violations.

Two primary SDWIS datasets will be used with the first containg water system-level information inclduing system identification, numbers, system type, population served, geographic location, and ownership characteristics. The second dataset includes violation level records, documenting containment, violation type and dates.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
The primary research question for this project is:

Are rural water systems more likely to experience drinking water quality violations than urban water systems in the state of Georgia?

The outcome of interest is the occurence of drinking water quality violations (either as a binary indicator or collective count of violations per system). The primary predictor of interest is rural versus urban area classification of the water system. The analysis will explore patterns in violation frequency and distribution across rural and urban systems and assess whetehr disparities persisit after accounting for system and community characteristics.

# Methods/Planned Analysis Approach 

The analysis will begin with data cleaning and processing, including merging datasets, handling missing values, and recording categorical variables at the water system level. Exploratory data analysis will be used to examine distributions, identify patterns, and visualize difference in violations between rural and urban systems. Descriptive summaries will be used to examine the distribution of water system characteristics such as size and rural urban classfication. Simple visualization will be used to compare drinking water violations between rural and urban systems, such as bar plots showing the proportions of systems with violations and histograms of violation counts. 


# Sample Exploratory Data Analysis 
This will load the SDWA public water systems datatset and the RUCA ZIP code classification datatser into R. These datasets contian infromation on public water system characterstics and rural-urban classifications. 
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

systems <- read_csv(here("data", "raw-data", "SDWA_PUB_WATER_SYSTEMS.csv"))
ruca <- read_csv(here("data", "raw-data", "RUCA-codes-2020-zipcode.csv"))

glimpse(systems)
glimpse(ruca)

systems_ga|>
```


This will filter the public water system dataset to include only systems located in GA using the STATE_CODE variable. After filtering, there are 5256 remaining observations, confirming that the restriction was applied and to gain the final sample size for analysis. 
```{r}
systems_ga <- systems |>
  filter(STATE_CODE == "GA")

nrow(systems_ga)
```


Looking at the types of public water systems in Georgia, community water systems were the most common (n=2722), followed by transient non-community systems n= 2,004 and non-transiet non-community systems (n=530)
  * CWS (community water system)
  * TNCWS (transient non-community water system)
  * NTNCWS (non-transient non-community water system)
```{r}
systems_ga |>
  count(PWS_TYPE_CODE, sort = TRUE)
  
```

This allows for summary statistics to be calculate, in this context, this shows the distirbution and range of populations served by public water systems in Georgia
```{r}
summary (systems_ga$POPULATION_SERVED_COUNT)
  
```


This puts into persepctive of how many people that the water systems serve. Approximately 25% of the systems served fewer than 49 people, while 75% of the systems served fewer than 262 people. 
```{r}
systems_ga_filtered <- systems_ga |>
  filter(POPULATION_SERVED_COUNT>0)
ggplot(
  data=systems_ga_filtered,
  mapping = aes(x=POPULATION_SERVED_COUNT)
) +
  geom_histogram(bins=40)+
  scale_x_log10(
    breaks = c(10,100,1000,10000,100000),
    labels = c("10", "100", "1,000", "10,000", "100,000")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Population Served by Public Water Systems in Georgia",
    x= "Population Served",
    y= "Number of Systems"
  )
  
```

In this step, I filtered the to include public water systems in Georgia that serve a population > 0. After this, a histogram was created to visualize the distribution of population sized serve by the public systems. 

The histogram appear to be a strongly skewed right distribution, showing a large varation in system size. Most water systems serve a smaller population of individuals with the median population served being 100 people. However, the long right tail is a result of some water systems serving a large population of individuals reaching up to 1 million indivduals. 




## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with BioRender.
We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("assets","antigen-recognition.png"))
```




## Data acquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. I generally recommend the `here` package.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable <- readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

_Include citations in your Qmd file using BibTeX, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your BibTeX reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like.
